# **Key Takeaways**  

### 🔹 **Trends and Patterns:**  
📊 **Bimodal Age Distribution** – Two distinct **age groups dominate** claim filings, suggesting different risk categories.  
📊 **46% of individuals are obese**, with **severe obesity linked to higher claims**.  
📊 **Smokers consistently file higher claims** than non-smokers.  

### 🔹 **Risk & Health Factors:**  
⚠️ **Blood Pressure Risks** – **813 individuals suffer from hypertension**, with **Stage 2 and fatal cases claiming the most**.  
⚠️ **Severely obese individuals with fatal hypertension** had the **highest claim amounts**.  
⚠️ **Diabetes alone did not impact claims**, but **diabetic smokers had significantly higher claim amounts**.  

### 🔹 **Demographic & Regional Influence:**  
📍 **Northeast region had the highest claim amounts**, despite only **17.3% of people coming from there**.  
📍 **Smokers in all categories (male, female, diabetic, non-diabetic) had higher claims**.  
📍 **Families with fewer children tend to file higher claims**, suggesting an inverse relationship between **family size and claim amounts**.
